It highlights the geographic shift in cultural hubs, from historically Black neighborhoods like Harlem and Crown Heights to areas like SoHo, Chelsea, and the West Village. The map also tracks the dual pressures of displacement and the AIDS crisis on Black and Latinx LGBTQ+ communities. New York’s queer nightlife reflected these transformations in venues ranging from community halls to boutique stores and dance clubs."
